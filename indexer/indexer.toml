### Option 1: Utilize a known preset. See config/presets.go 
### for available presets. i.e OP, Base, Zora, PGN, etc.
### -- Curently setup for Local Devnet
preset = 901

### Option 2: Custom Networks
###
### These contract addresses MUST be the Proxy contract
### addresses and not the implementation

# system-config = ""
# optimism-portal = ""
# l2-output-oracle = ""
# l1-cross-domain-messenger = ""
# l1-standard-brigde = ""
# l1-erc721-bridge = ""
###
### Deployment block height of the rollup. Must be set
### correctly otherwise the ETL will start from L1 genesis
### resulting in a lot of wasted work.
# l1-starting-height = 0
###

## Required ETL configuration which controls
## the rate and and range at data retrieval
l1-polling-interval = 5000
l2-polling-interval = 5000

l1-header-buffer-size = 1000
l2-header-buffer-size = 1000

### For the devnet, we'll use a confirmation depth of 0.
### However important to set for live networks to avoid
### the ETL getting into a stuck state due to a reorg
# l1-confirmation-depth = 10
# l2-confirmation-depth = 75  (rough 10 L1 block equivalent)
